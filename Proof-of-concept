This code builds on concepts from Amnesty International’s Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) and Kaspersky’s self-check scripts, 
as outlined in the previous blueprint. It’s a simplified, proof-of-concept script designed to run on a Linux/macOS system, 
analyzing device backups or logs for potential Pegasus traces.
Note that this is not a complete antivirus Pegasus’s complexity requires ongoing updates, expert reverse-engineering, and real-world testing beyond this scope.

Dependencies: 

Python 3, libimobiledevice (for iOS), adb (for Android), and MVT (optional for enhanced analysis).

- Setup: 
Install dependencies on a Linux/macOS system. For iOS, ensure libimobiledevice is set up to access backups.
For Android, ensure adb is configured.

- Data: 
Requires an iOS backup (unencrypted) or Android device connected via USB for log extraction.

How to Use

1. Setup:
   - Install dependencies: pip install requests, sudo apt install libimobiledevice-utils (for iOS), sudo apt install adb (for Android).
   - For iOS, create an unencrypted backup using idevicebackup2 backup --full /path/to/backup.
   - For Android, connect the device via USB with debugging enabled.
2. Run the Script:
   - For iOS: python3 pegasus_detector.py --ios-backup /path/to/backup
   - For Android: python3 pegasus_detector.py --android
3. Output: Results are logged to pegasus_scan_log.txt and printed to the console.

This is a foundation, not a production-ready antivirus. 
For high-risk users, combine it with tools like MVT and consult experts
